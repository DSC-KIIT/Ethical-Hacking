## Before you start

- If you're new to information security, forget everything you know about hacking.
- Don't start using tools without reading about pen testing and how it works.
- Don't download or use tools if you haven't audited its code.
- Don't use these tools to do stupid things like investigating/hacking without consent on your friends, or worst, your recruiter.
- Read books, manuals, articles, be curious and not just a [script kiddie](https://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-Becoming-a-Script-Kiddie).
- I wish you don't use these tools for illegal purposes, but if you do, I sure hope you know what you're doing.
- Practice using challenges, not real targets!
